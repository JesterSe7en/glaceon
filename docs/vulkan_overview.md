# High level overview of the Vulkan API initialization and usage.

1. **Vulkan Instance Initialization:**
   - Create a `VkApplicationInfo` structure with information about your application.
   - Create a `VkInstanceCreateInfo` structure with details about the instance.
   - Call `vkCreateInstance` to create the Vulkan instance.

2. **Physical Device and Queue Family Initialization:**
   - Enumerate available physical devices using `vkEnumeratePhysicalDevices`.
   - Choose a physical device based on your requirements (e.g., features, extensions).
   - Find a suitable queue family for graphics operations (drawing commands).

3. **Logical Device and Queue Initialization:**
   - Create a `VkDeviceCreateInfo` structure with information about device features and enabled extensions.
   - Call `vkCreateDevice` to create the logical device.
   - Retrieve a handle to the graphics queue using `vkGetDeviceQueue`.

4. **Surface Creation:**
   - Create a platform-specific surface (e.g., using GLFW, SDL, etc.).
   - Query the surface capabilities and formats.

5. **Swap Chain Creation:**
   - Choose the number of images in the swap chain and the format.
   - Create a swap chain using `vkCreateSwapchainKHR`.
   - Retrieve the swap chain images using `vkGetSwapchainImagesKHR`.

6. **Image Views and Framebuffers:**
   - Create image views for each swap chain image.
   - Create framebuffers for rendering using these image views.

7. **Graphics Pipeline Setup:**
   - Define the vertex and fragment shaders (using SPIR-V).
   - Create a pipeline layout and pipeline with the shader stages, vertex input, input assembly, rasterization, etc.

8. **Command Buffer Recording:**
   - Allocate command buffers for rendering commands.
   - Start recording commands into the command buffers.

9. **Rendering Commands:**
   - Begin rendering pass with `vkCmdBeginRenderPass`.
   - Bind the graphics pipeline with `vkCmdBindPipeline`.
   - Specify vertex and index buffers, if required.
   - Issue drawing commands with `vkCmdDraw` or `vkCmdDrawIndexed`.
   - End the render pass with `vkCmdEndRenderPass`.

10. **Presentation:**
    - Acquire the next image from the swap chain using `vkAcquireNextImageKHR`.
    - Present the image to the screen using `vkQueuePresentKHR`.

11. **Cleanup:**
    - Destroy Vulkan objects (e.g., pipelines, shader modules, command buffers, etc.).
    - Destroy the swap chain.
    - Destroy the logical device.
    - Destroy the Vulkan instance.
